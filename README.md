# OlympicsData
This dataset provides an opportunity to ask questions about how the Olympics have evolved over time, including questions about the participation and performance of women, different nations, and different sports and events.


I start this project by downloading the Olympics history dataset from kaggle website. I then load this dataset into a PostgreSQL database. Meaning we store this data into database tables. Once the data is stored in tables, I then write SQL queries to fetch different information about the history of Olympic games.
I have come up with 20 different SQL queries which we can write on this Olympics dataset.
