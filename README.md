# OlympicsData
This dataset provides an opportunity to ask questions about how the Olympics have evolved over time, including questions about the participation and performance of women, different nations, and different sports and events.


I start this project by downloading the Olympics history dataset from kaggle website. I then load this dataset into a Jupyter Notebook (Open source Software), to perform Analysis and answer some questions about the dataset.
